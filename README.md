# Epic ScratchX extensions --> Neural Nets and Trivia!

The first extension:
The Neural Blocks ScratchX extension aims to empower kids to build their very own neural networks in the friendly world of Scratch! This javascript code creates a set of custom scratch blocks that connect to a home-made neural network trained on the classic MNIST dataset (the network runs on a Python server, which the blocks query). 


The second extension:
A ScratchX trivia project! My program connects to the JService API in order to challenge users with a diverse range of fun/enlightening trivia questions.
(My first attempt at getting Scratch blocks to communicate with an external API.)
