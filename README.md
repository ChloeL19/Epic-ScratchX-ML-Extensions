# Epic ScratchX extensions --> Neural Nets meet Scratch!

The Neural Blocks ScratchX extension aims to empower kids to build their very own neural networks in the friendly world of Scratch! This javascript code creates a set of custom scratch blocks that connect to a home-made neural network trained on the classic MNIST dataset (the network runs on a Python server, which the blocks query).
